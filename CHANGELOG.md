* Backport upstream fix for generating support bundles ([PR #221])
  * This was a regression introduced in Syncthing version 2.1.3.
* Fix git submodules not being rebuilt in certain scenarios ([PR #222])

### Version 3.8

* Fix bug that led to inefficiency when renaming files in shared folders that use SAF ([Issue #214], [PR #215])
* Update dependencies ([PR #216])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #211])

### Version 3.7

* Fix the "stop early when idle" feature not stopping early in some scenarios ([Issue #212], [PR #213])
  * This was a regression introduced in version 3.6.

### Version 3.6

* Align sync schedule intervals to Unix timestamp 0 ([Issue #207], [PR #208])
  * This ensures two devices running BasicSync with the same sync schedule settings will wake at the same time.

### Version 3.5

* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #205])

### Version 3.4

* Update syncthing to 2.1.2 ([PR #200])
  * BasicSync now uses the upstream Syncthing defaults for the number of file hashers, but only for new installations. For existing installations, to use the upstream defaults, set hashers to 0 for every folder and also the default folder in Web UI -> Gear Icon -> Advanced.
* Add support for direct file access to SD cards and USB drives ([PR #201])
  * This is only supported on Android >=11.
  * Existing shared folders on external storage need to be removed and re-added to take advantage of this. They previously used Android's storage access framework (SAF).
* Change storage type wording to direct file access vs. SAF instead of internal vs. external ([PR #201])
* Automatically refresh folder selector if contents change while browsing ([PR #201])
* Fix opening folders containing file conflicts on SD cards and USB drives ([PR #201])
* Fix opening folders containing file conflicts when using SAF ([PR #201])
* Open folder picker to proper directory when granting missing SAF permissions after importing an existing configuration ([PR #201])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #202], [PR #204])
* Clean up English translation strings ([PR #203])

### Version 3.3

* Update dynamic background color to match AOSP Settings ([PR #195])
* Fix back button background being opaque on QR code scanner screen ([PR #196])
* Update golang to 1.26.5 ([PR #199])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #194])

### Version 3.2

* Add optional `INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS` permission to allow two copies of BasicSync installed in different users/profiles on the same device to communicate with each other over localhost on Android 17 ([Issue #192], [PR #193])

### Version 3.1

* Fix UI crash when viewing sync conflicts if the same file is reported multiple times ([Issue #188], [PR #189])
* Improve fade transition from loading spinner to the Syncthing web UI ([PR #190])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #191])

### Version 3.0

* Add support for using Android's Storage Access Framework (SAF) to access external storage (eg. SD cards) ([PR #177], [PR #182])
  * This is less efficient and reliable than syncing to internal storage. Please read [the documentation](./README.md#external-storage) before using it.
* Update target API version to API 37 (Android 17) ([PR #179])
  * **Action required**: Android 17 now blocks local network connections by default, which in many cases forces sync traffic to pass through Syncthing's relay servers. Open the app to grant the new permission for allowing local network access again.
* Reduce minimum API version to API 26 (Android 8.0) ([Issue #165], [PR #167])

* Update dependencies ([PR #187])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #173], [PR #186])

### Version 2.4

* Disable floating web UI nav bar on Android TV to fix arrow button navigation ([PR #163])
  * This was a regression introduced in version 2.3.
* Close open dropdown menus in Syncthing's web UI when pressing back ([PR #164])

### Version 2.3

* Show device sync state in notification ([Issue #150], [PR #157])
* Make Syncthing's web UI edge to edge and remove duplicate app bar ([PR #159])
* Close open dialogs in Syncthing's web UI before closing the entire page when pressing back ([PR #160])

* Fix error when importing a configuration zip before Syncthing starts for the first time ([PR #144])
* Update golang to 1.26.4 ([PR #145])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #139])

### Version 1.30

* Fix exit button not working when app is in recents screen, but not currently open ([Issue #130], [PR #133])
* Fix crash when opening external links in the web UI and no browser is installed ([Issue #131], [PR #132])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #134])

### Version 1.29

* Fix warnings about sync conflicts being shown for files that do not exist locally ([Issue #128], [PR #129])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #127])

### Version 1.28

* Update syncthing to 2.1.0 ([PR #125])
* Add quick settings tile to cycle through auto mode, manually started, and manually stopped ([Issue #124], [PR #126])

* Minor bug fix for long-clickable preferences ([PR #113])
* Add fallback logic for devices running Linux kernel version <3.15 ([Issue #114], [PR #115])
* Use distinct version code for each APK split ([Issue #111], [PR #118])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #117])

### Version 1.25

* Add optional button to persistent notification to exit the app entirely ([Issue #105], [PR #107])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #106])

### Version 1.24

* Add support for reporting sync conflicts ([Issue #79], [PR #102])
* Update dependencies ([PR #103])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #100])

### Version 1.23

* Resend persistent notification if it is inadvertently dismissed on Android 14+ ([Issue #98], [PR #99])
  * Folks who prefer to have no notification can still disable it from Android's settings.

### Version 1.22

* Switch to using exact alarms for the time schedule feature ([Issue #83], [PR #97])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #94])

### Version 1.21

* Update syncthing to 2.0.16 ([PR #93])
* Fix time schedule feature to use the system's realtime clock that still advances while the device is in deep sleep ([Issue #83], [PR #84])
* Exclude Syncthing database during imports and exports ([Issue #86], [PR #85])
  * This prevents data loss when importing a config if the actual files in shared folders are missing. Syncthing will now download missing files instead of thinking they were deleted.
  * This also allows exporting the config on one device and importing it on a different device.
* Improve Android backup opt-out to also include D2D transfers since those cannot be done safely ([PR #87])
  * Users should use the builtin import/export mechanism instead.
* Prevent Syncthing from running when the local storage permission is denied ([Issue #86], [PR #88])
  * This prevents data loss because when the permission is denied, Android only hides files, not folders. `.stfolder` remains visible, so Syncthing would think all files were deleted.
* Fix folder picker button incorrectly being clickable when editing existing shared folder ([PR #89])
* Backport upstream golang fix to resolve crash on 32-bit devices running Android <11 ([PR #90])
* Update golang to 1.26.2 ([PR #92])
* Simplify workaround for avoiding pidfd crash on Android <=11 ([PR #91])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #78])

### Version 1.20

* Stop automatically replacing `127.0.0.1` with `::1` for the GUI listen address ([PR #76])
  * This was originally intended to make the GUI dual-stack, but didn't actually work that way. Now, the default behavior matches upstream Syncthing.
* Fix sync protocol listen addresses being reset after a full restart of Syncthing ([Issue #75], [PR #77])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #74])

### Version 1.19

* Fix Syncthing never running when location permissions are denied after setting up allowed Wi-Fi SSIDs ([Issue #68], [PR #73])

### Version 1.18

* Fix reproducible builds issue caused by a timestamp field in autogenerated Syncthing asset files ([PR #71])

* Update dependencies ([PR #66])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #63])

* Add support for allowing external apps to control when Syncthing runs via Android broadcasts ([PR #60])
  * This is disabled by default.
* Update golang to 1.26.1 ([PR #61])
* Sync translations from Weblate ([PR #62])

### Version 1.14

* Update syncthing to 2.0.15 ([PR #58])

* Add Hungarian translations ([PR #43], [PR #47])
* Display the reason syncthing is paused/stopped ([PR #44])

### Version 1.10

* Add option to respect Android's auto-sync data setting ([Issue #39], [PR #40])
  * This is enabled by default.

### Version 1.9

* Make configuration import atomic ([PR #37])
  * If the import fails, the existing configuration remains unchanged now.
* Add support for interval-based time schedule ([Issue #14], [Issue #36], [PR #38])

### Version 1.8

* Shut down all listening sockets when syncthing is paused ([Issue #26], [PR #27])

### Version 1.4

* Update syncthing to 2.0.14 ([PR #10])
* Disable badge (dot on launcher icon) for persistent notifications by default ([PR #11])
  * This only applies to new installs. For existing installs, this can be disabled from Android's notification settings for BasicSync's "Background services" notification channel.
